    <p class="para">During my undergraduate studies in Computer Science and Engineering, I have gained extensive hands-on experience through various academic and personal projects. Notably, I developed a comprehensive web application for User Identification system as part of my coursework in Software Engineering. This project involved designing the front-end interface using <u>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</u>, while implementing the back-end functionalities with MongoDB. Additionally, I am undergoing a summer internship at <u>Prodigy InfoTech Solutions</u>, significantly improving the performance of their internal tools. My involvement in the universityâ€™s coding club allowed me to participate in multiple hackathons, where I honed my problem-solving skills and achieved top placements. These experiences have solidified my technical foundation and have equipped me with the practical skills necessary to excel in the field of computer science.</p><br>
    <p class="para">I am experienced in programming languages like C,C++,Java and Python. Done a project in C++ named <u>Student Management system</u></p>
